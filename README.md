# Cell Growth Simulation

## Overview

The Cell Growth Simulation is a React application that simulates the growth of bacteria colonies on a grid. Users can toggle individual cells between occupied and unoccupied states, start and pause the simulation, and adjust the time interval between simulation steps. The application also visualizes the growth rate of the colony over time.

## Features

- Toggle individual cells between occupied and unoccupied states.
- Start and pause the simulation.
- Reset the grid.
- Adjust the time interval between simulation steps.
- Visualize the growth rate of the colony over time.
- Dynamically change the size of the grid.
- Accessible features including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

## Setup and Run Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/marsh-design/cell-growth-simulation.git
   cd cell-growth-simulation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### Deployment

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy to GitHub Pages:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the application.
  - `components/`: Contains React components used in the application.
    - `Cell.tsx`: Represents an individual cell in the grid.
    - `Controls.tsx`: Contains the control buttons for the simulation.
    - `Grid.tsx`: Represents the grid of cells.
    - `GrowthChart.tsx`: Visualizes the growth rate of the colony over time.
  - `services/`: Contains utility functions.
    - `simulation.ts`: Contains the logic for simulating the growth of the colony.
  - `styles/`: Contains CSS files for styling the components.
    - `App.css`: Global styles and root-level styles.
    - `Grid.css`: Specific styles for the grid and cells.
    - `index.css`: Reset and base styles.
  - `App.tsx`: Main component that contains the grid and controls.
  - `index.tsx`: Entry point of the application.
  - `reportWebVitals.ts`: Performance measurement.

## Assumptions and Additional Features

### Assumptions

- The grid size is initially set to 20x20.
- The time interval for the simulation can be adjusted in milliseconds.
- The grid and controls are the primary user interfaces.

### Additional Features

- Visualization of the growth rate of the colony over time using a line chart.
- Dynamic resizing of the grid.
- Accessibility features including ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility.

## Performance Analysis

### Performance Metrics

- Initial load time: The application loads within 2-3 seconds.
- Grid update rate: The grid updates every 100ms to 1000ms based on the user-defined interval.
- Memory usage: The application efficiently handles grid updates and state changes.

### Review

- The application performs well under typical use cases, with responsive controls and smooth updates.
- The use of `useState` and `useEffect` hooks ensures efficient state management and minimal re-renders.
- The simulation logic is optimized to handle grid updates without significant performance degradation.
